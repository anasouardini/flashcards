# Fluency

"The linguistic ability plus the cultural awareness, to smoothly and confidently interact with native speakers in a meaninful way." â€” Luca Lampariello

The interaction involves sending and receiving in both oral and textual forms and you should be fluent in **all** of 4 types of fluencies to be considered as fluent in a certain language.

Besides those 4 forms, there is also the contextual fluency of a topic or area of specialty: try to learn the most relivent words after you acquire the popular ones that are used and every context (like the word "the"). Not only that, but learn the meanings of a word that are the most relivant to your goal and ignore the other meanings.

# Vocabulary

1. Active: the words you read and memorize.
2. Passive: the contextual meaning of those words.

Do not learn meanings or verb forms that are of no use to you. Also try to learn sentences and phrases instead of word by word.
